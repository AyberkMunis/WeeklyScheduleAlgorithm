# WeeklyScheduleAlgorithm :notebook_with_decorative_cover:
The main purpose of this algorithm, is arranging weekly schedules of companies that have multiple tasks for each employee.  The algorithm assumes that an employee can only
do one duty on each day, so it restricts usage of the name more than one time for this day.

Problems are possible to face with
1. Infinite Loop
If the loop in classes is in an infinite loop, your condition must be impossible. You can check your condition and check again.
2. Don't Save the database
If you don't save the database, your algorithm should be crashed. Save your database and try again

---------The Main Process--------------
1. Selecting the job column that you want to manage
2. If you have managed your database before, write the name you have typed before FOR THIS JOB(If you have typed any other names for other jobs, you will write them when you are editing these jobs)). (Ex. I wrote Ayberk to Job1 on Monday, so before editing Job1 column I must write "Ayberk" when the algorthim asks me.)
3. Writing a new name 
4. Writing how many times a week will this person do this job 
5. Repeat this process until you have finished your names list.
6. If you have finished the list, press q and press enter to quit to the main menu
7. It is possible to choose another job column and repeat this process for it
8. If you want to leave, type "bye" and press enter.
